# 🌱 Nafas Project

**Nafas** (meaning *breath* in Uzbek) is a project that focuses on **real-time air quality monitoring** using **portable sensor keychains**. These keychains allow individuals to measure air quality wherever they are and contribute their data to a collective **real-time mapping platform**. The aim is to provide **community-driven insights** into air pollution levels and support better environmental decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔑 **Portable Sensor Keychains** – Small, affordable, and easy-to-carry devices for measuring air quality.  
- 📡 **Real-Time Data Upload** – Sensors send measurements directly to the cloud.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Air Quality Maps** – Visualize live and historical data across different locations.  
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Understand pollution patterns, hotspots, and trends.  
- 👥 **Community Participation** – Individuals, schools, and organizations can join and share their data.
